# Functions & Scope Practice â€“ NOVI Frontend Module Assignment

## About the Project

This repository contains my solutions for the **Functions, Methods & Scope** exercises from the Frontend Development module at [Novi University](https://www.novi.nl).
The purpose of this assignment is to gain hands-on experience with **function declarations**, **return values**, **variable scope**, and **loops** in JavaScript. The focus is on writing clean, modular functions that return values instead of relying on side effects like `console.log()`.
